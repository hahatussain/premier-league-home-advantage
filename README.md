# Premier-League-Home-Advantage

It is a well known fact that teams perform well when playing at their home grounds. Here, I have shown the same with simple plots.

FTHG : Full Time Home Goals, FTAG : Full Time Away Goals

An interesting takeaway from the analysis is that this difference falls drastically in 20-21 season. There is a high chance that this is due to the absence of fans in stadiums in that season.
